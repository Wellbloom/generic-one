# Recurring Sessions Reorganization Summary

## Overview

All recurring sessions components have been successfully reorganized from the generic `payasyougo/` directory into the client-specific folder structure under `src/components/client/recurring-sessions/`.

## New Directory Structure

## Updated Import Paths

### Before (Old)

```typescript
import PayAsYouGoDashboard from "@/components/payasyougo/PayAsYouGoDashboard";
import PayAsYouGoSetup from "@/components/payasyougo/PayAsYouGoSetup";
```

### After (New)

```typescript
import {
  RecurringSessionsDashboard,
  RecurringSessionsSetup,
} from "@/components/client/recurring-sessions";
// or
import { RecurringSessionsDashboard } from "@/components/client";
```

## The 6 Setup Steps Confirmed

All 6 steps of the "Setup Recurring Sessions" flow are now properly organized under the client folder structure:

1. **Schedule Selection** (`ScheduleSelector.tsx`) - ✅ Under client/
2. **Pricing Confirmation** (`PricingConfirmation.tsx`) - ✅ Under client/
3. **Therapeutic Agreement** (`TherapeuticAgreement.tsx`) - ✅ Under client/
4. **Payment Method** (`PaymentMethod.tsx`) - ✅ Under client/
5. **Emergency Contact** (`EmergencyContact.tsx`) - ✅ Under client/
6. **Final Confirmation** (`FinalConfirmation.tsx`) - ✅ Under client/

## Benefits of This Reorganization

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Client functionality is now completely separated from admin functionality
2. **Better Code Organization**: Related components are grouped together logically
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify client-specific recurring sessions code
4. **Consistent Naming**: Component names now clearly indicate their purpose and scope
5. **Clean Import Paths**: Barrel exports provide clean, organized imports
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add new client-specific recurring sessions features

## Files Updated

- `src/components/client/dashboard/ClientDashboard.tsx` - Updated import paths
- `src/components/client/index.ts` - Added recurring sessions exports
- All moved components - Updated file headers and component names
- Removed empty `src/components/payasyougo/` directory

## Next Steps

The recurring sessions functionality is now properly organized under the client folder structure. All components maintain their original functionality while being properly categorized for client-specific use.
